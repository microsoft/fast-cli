# fast-cli-migrate-1.0.0-alpha.1--index

This change targets the `index.ts` file as the entrypoint for consuming registered components. Since the registration has changed from the `design-system.ts` file to the component file, which are imported to the components `index.ts`, the import has changed to target that file.

## Deprecated version

```ts
import "./design-system.js";
```

## After running ESLint with `fix` option

```ts
import "./components/index.js";
```

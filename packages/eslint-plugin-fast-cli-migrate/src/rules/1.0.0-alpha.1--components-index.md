# fast-cli-migrate-1.0.0-alpha.1--components-index

The components index rule attempts to update the components folder `index.ts` file which should be exporting components. This change imports the `define.ts` file directly which should contain the registered component.

## Deprecated version

```ts
import { foo } from "./foo/define.js";

export default [
    foo()
];
```

## After running ESLint with `fix` option

```ts
import "./foo/define.js";
```

# fast-cli-migrate-1.0.0-alpha.1--define

This change will remove the deprecated `.compose()` method and replace it with `.define()` executed on a component definition.

## Assumptions

- A single file is exporting a `.compose()` method from an imported web component class

## Deprecated version

```ts
import { Foo } from "./foo.js";
import { definition } from "./foo.definition.js";

export const foo = Foo.compose(definition);
```

## After running ESLint with `fix` option

```ts
import { designSystem } from "../../design-system.js";
import { definition } from "./foo.definition.js";

definition.define(designSystem.registry);
```
